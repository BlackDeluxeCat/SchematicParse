ui.calculator.help.content = A powerful, highly customizable schematic calculation tool, usually compatible with mod buildings. \nThe interface is divided into tag bar, addition bar, building sandbox, and sandbox abacus from top to bottom. \
  \n\nBy default, there is one sandbox. You can create a new sandbox, create a sandbox from a schematic, or create a copy from an existing sandbox. The tag bar is responsible for isolating and managing these sandboxes. \
  \nThe addition bar can add virtual building cards to the sandbox. \
  \nBuilding cards in the sandbox have two important attributes: [accent]building count[] and [accent]production factor input/output[], which can be modified as needed. The product of input/output and building count will be used for calculation. Different cards are independent of each other, even if they are the same type of building.\
  \nThe sandbox abacus displays the production factors involved in the sandbox and automatically calculates the sum of input/output items. A sum of 0 means that the production of this factor exactly offsets the consumption, and the production factor is [accent]balanced[], displayed as [darkgray]gray[].\
  \n\nThe core function is the [accent]balancing[](balance button) of building cards. When balancing a certain card, you can select a production factor that is currently not balanced in the sandbox abacus, and automatically set the building count of the card until the production factor is [accent]balanced[].\
  \n[purple]Balanced building count[] may be a decimal, which means some buildings do not need to work at full efficiency to input/output enough resources. The bright [white]building count[] is the number of buildings you must build, which is always the ceiling of the balanced value, which is reasonable!
